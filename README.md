# Spot My Good Boy

This project is the result of the collaboration between Yoni, Ava, Josselin,
and Joachim for Stanford TreeHacks 2024 (February 16 - 18, 2024).

## Short description
Introducing Spot My Good Boy: your memory's best friend! Never forget a thing with
Spot. Life-changing companionship for seniors!

## Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from a desire to empower 💪 elderly individuals who may struggle with memory loss to live more independently and confidently in their own homes. We recognized the importance of creating a solution that not only addresses the practical challenge of finding objects but also provides companionship and reassurance. 😊

## What it does
Spot my good boy is a revolutionary dog-like 🐾 robot designed to assist the elderly in locating misplaced items within their living space. Using advanced technology and cutting-edge AI, it responds to natural language commands, navigates the environment to find requested objects, and provides verbal feedback to confirm its success😊🎉. Additionally, it serves as a vigilant companion, capable of alerting users to potential hazards in their surroundings. 🤖🔍👀

## How we built it
We leveraged cutting-edge technology to retrofit a Boston Dynamics robot with custom software and hardware components. Through intensive programming and integration efforts, we enabled the robot to understand and execute complex commands, navigate autonomously, and communicate effectively with users. 💻🌟 This involved extensive collaboration between a huge diversity of technical experts 👏👥 from our team: software engineers, hardware specialists, and user experience designers. 💻🛠️👩‍💻

## Challenges we ran into
Developing Spot my good boy presented several significant challenges, including: 😨

- Integrating natural language processing capabilities to ensure seamless communication. 🤖🗣️
- Designing an intuitive user interface for elderly users with varying levels of technological familiarity. 👵👴🖥️
- Implementing robust object recognition and navigation algorithms to locate items accurately. 📸🔎
- Managing multiple AI agents and API calls to services such as Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), OpenAI's Whispr, GPT-4, and OpenCV cascade models for object detection. 🤖🤖🤖
- Hardware integration for sound, microphone, camera, and movement controls, ensuring seamless interaction and functionality across different components. 🎤📷🕹️
